hmmlearn implements the Hidden Markov Models (HMMs). The HMM is a generative probabilistic model, in which a sequence of observable variables is generated by a sequence of internal hidden states. The hidden states are not observed directly. The transitions between hidden states are assumed to have the form of a (first-order) Markov chain. They can be specified by the start probability vector pi 
and a transition probability matrix A. The emission probability of an observable B can be any distribution with parameters conditioned on the current hidden state. The HMM is completely determined by Pi, A and B.
